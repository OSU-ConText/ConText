# ConText

database.py contains functions to run the database
database-test.py is a console application to run some of the functions in the database so you can see how they work

I recommend using SQLiteStudio to view the db https://github.com/pawelsalawa/sqlitestudio/releases

To run
-Open Console
-Navigate to this directory
-Run 'python3 database-test.py'
